Not implemented yet. Idea: contain edge case strings within this file,
that algs should always test against. for example, string:

000000000000111111111111

automatically disqualifies the algs of the following form:

000111 000011
000111 100000
011111 001100
etc...

because none can apply successfully their rule as all valid partitions
will merely be a shift of their rules.
